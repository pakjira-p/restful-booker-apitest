# Restful Booker API Testing

This project demonstrates API testing of the [Restful Booker](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html) service using **Postman** and **Newman**. It replicates real-world QA workflows, covering core API functionalities through both positive and negative test scenarios.

🚧 This portfolio is currently under development. Some parts may be incomplete or subject to change.

## 🧪 Test Scope Based on API Documentation

Based on the official [Restful Booker API Docs](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html), the following endpoints were tested:

### ✔️ Covered Endpoints:

- `GET /ping` – Health check
- `POST /auth` – Create token
- `POST /booking` – Create booking
- `GET /booking` – Retrieve all booking IDs
- `GET /booking/:id` – Get booking by ID
- `PUT /booking/:id` – Full update
- `PATCH /booking/:id` – Partial update
- `DELETE /booking/:id` – Delete booking

### ❌ Out of Scope:

- Rate limiting
- Security testing (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS)
- UI testing

Each endpoint is tested with:
- ✅ Positive cases
- ❌ Negative cases (e.g., invalid input, missing auth)
- 🔄 Edge cases (e.g., blank fields, invalid formats)



## ▶️ How to Run Tests

### 🛠️ Prerequisites:
- Node.js installed → [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- Newman installed:

```bash
npm install -g newman
```

### 🚀 Run the Collection with Newman:
**Clone this repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pakjira-p/restful-booker-apitest.git
```

**Navigate into the project directory (optional, as this happens automatically after cloning):**
```bash
cd restful-booker-apitest
```

**Run the Postman Collection with Newman:**
```bash
newman run postman/RestfulBooker.postman_collection.json \
  -e postman/RestfulBookerEnvironment.json \
  -r cli,html \
  --reporter-html-export newman/newman-report.html
```
The test report will be generated in: `newman/newman-report.html`



## 🧰 Technologies

- Postman – For designing, managing, and executing API tests manually
- Newman – For automated CLI test runs and generating HTML reports
- Jira – Bug tracking and issue reporting
- Google Docs & Google Sheets – For documentation (test plan, bug report, test result)
